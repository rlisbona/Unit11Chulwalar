Case Study Deliverables


Section the code into modules for importing the data, cleaning/modifying the data, exploring data, analyzing data
 - 2 different use cases to run
     Forecast and Arima
 - Was the following used, SES, HOLT, hw


Interpretation:


What is the best model for the export data? How do you define best (Stats methodology) 

Which forecast model is the best fit? How do you define it (Stats methodlogy)

More than one model may be equally good. How do you choose among equally good models. 


Forecast accuracy measures (This would go toward the interpretation)
ME		Mean Error
RMSE		Root Mean Squared Error
MAE		Mean Absolute Error
MPE		Mean percentage error
MAPE		Mean absolute percentage error
MASE		Mean absolute scaled error
ACF1		Autocorrelation errors at lag
THEIU

Final Conclusion

 - Give conclusion of analysis of forecasting exports





Notes from emails
 - Yes. For now, do not get into the formulation of AIC. Just remember that lower the better.

 - Yes, you will need a couple of measurements to select the model. RMSE is a good metric. 
 - Also, compare these numbers for different models as they will not make much sense on their own.

 - You have to select a couple of error measurements (RMSE, AIC for example) and compare those values across all models.    
 - Select the one which has the minimum for these values and also visually check for a good fit.


 - You are supposed to make the code modular, include interpretations for the graphs and also select the best method from the already implemented ones.
