Yes. For now, do not get into the formulation of AIC. Just remember that lower the better.

Yes, you will need a couple of measurements to select the model. RMSE is a good metric. 
Also, compare these numbers for different models as they will not make much sense on their own.

You have to select a couple of error measurements (RMSE, AIC for example) and compare those values across all models. 
Select the one which has the minimum for these values and also visually check for a good fit.


You are supposed to make the code modular, include interpretations for the graphs and also select the best method from the already implemented ones.
